## ShipGlows development environment

- Environment schema: `shipglows-project-environment/v2`
- Server manager: `shipglows-devserver`
- Project kind: `flutter-web`
- Assigned port: `3014`
- Canonical local URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3014`
- Live status authority: Windows ShipGlows DevServer registry

Use the assigned URL for ordinary web projects. Browser extensions use their generated unpacked directory and browser extension manager instead of a normal page URL. Obsidian plugins use their declared build/watch script and an explicitly configured vault without an HTTP port. Do not substitute framework defaults such as Astro/Vite `4321` or a port from another project. Read the ShipGlows registry for live process and surface state; this durable document is not rewritten on start or stop.
